---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Step Download GIT from

Select Windows OS option and click- Install.

Now create one empty Folder in C drive e.g C:\GitLocalAks
in GIT command- use cd/c : to Navigate to C drive
type ls (Unix command): to get all list item within current path

Navigate to new folder e.g. cd /GitLocalAks
now do ls and see there is n files there as of now.

Clone the repositry in the GIT folder in C drive.
Go to Git HUB browser : Copy the GIT HUB repository URL start with e.g. https://github.com/Anuj007in/TestGitDemo.git-- to be use in later steps post clone.

Need to configure the GIT ac for Gt Hub repo:
Steps:
Now authenticate GIT with GIT Hub 
git config --global user.name "Anuj007in"
git config --global user.email anuj_rov@yahoo.com

Take the git hub url copied (above steps).
Navigate to the folder which is created in C drive manually
e.g. cd TestGitDemo/
Do cloning:
git clone https://github.com/Anuj007in/TestGitDemo.git
Now verify that TestGitDemo (from Hub ) is created in local C drive under the GitLocalAks.
Navigate to TestGitDemo(master) by cd /TestGitDemo UNIX command

Verify by ls command that GitHub folder is seen by below command: e.g. ls  - TestGitDemo/ should be displayed as ex. do ls to see iof Readme.md is seen in command 

create some sample text file in the local git hub folder :the local file which is created in local C drive and save with below command
To upload this file to hub first add this file to GIT- use below command
git add Randontext.txt
git status - check the status of the file
before upload to Git Hub need to commit this file as below:
COmmit it:
git commit -m "Anuj text commit" Randontext.txt
Push to GIT Hub:
git push -u origin master
above command will add the GitHUb folder to local folder
e.g. C:\GitLocalAks\TestGitDemo (this is the repo name in Git Hub)

2. Create GIT Hub:
https://github.com
Use your email Id to create an Account and click on Create new repository option and pass the name.
e.g. https://github.com/Anuj007in/TestGitDemo/blob/master/Randontext.txt
